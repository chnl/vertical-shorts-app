      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to our social vertical video publishing app! Your privacy is
        important to us, and we want to be transparent about how we collect,
        use, and share your information. By using our app, you agree to the
        terms of this privacy policy:
      </p>
      <h2>Information we collect</h2>
      <p>
        We collect information that you provide to us when you create an
        account, upload content, or interact with other users on our app. This
        may include your name, email address, and any content that you upload or
        post.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also collect information automatically when you use our app, such as
        your IP address, device type, and browsing history.
      </p>
      <h2>How we use your information</h2>
      <p>
        We use your information to provide and improve our app, to communicate
        with you about our app and any updates or changes, and to personalize
        your experience on our app.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also use your information for research and analytics purposes,
        and to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.
      </p>
      <h2>How we share your information</h2>
      <p>
        We may share your information with third-party service providers that
        help us operate our app, such as cloud hosting providers, analytics
        providers, and payment processors.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also share your information with other users of our app, but only
        to the extent necessary to facilitate your interactions on our app (for
        example, to display your username or profile picture).
      </p>
      <p>
        We will not sell, rent, or disclose your information to third parties
        for marketing purposes without your explicit consent.
      </p>
      <h2>How we protect your information</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect your information from
        unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification. However, no method of
        transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely
        secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your
        information.
      </p>
      <h2>Your choices</h2>
      <p>
        You may choose not to provide certain information to us, but this may
        limit your ability to use certain features of our app.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may also opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by
        following the instructions in those communications.
      </p>
      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you
        of any material changes by posting the new policy on our app and
        updating the "last updated" date at the top of this page.
      </p>
      <h2>Contact us</h2>
      <p>
